Coursera Project

In this assignment, you will analyse and predict housing prices using attributes or features such as square footage, number of bedrooms, number of floors and so on. A template notebook is provided in the lab; your job is to complete the ten questions. Some hints to the questions are given in the template notebook. You will use Watson Studio to perform the analysis, and share  an image of your finished Jupyter notebook with a URL.
